MariaDB is a drop-in replacement for mysql. It's kinda a better version of mysql. You can install it with brew.

The default user is root and there's no password when this is installed by default.

Login as root with no password:
```shell
mysql -uroot
```

On windows, start powershell with administrator privileges and after installing mariadb on windows, you need to reboot it.
